## How to contribute to the Envious Programming Language

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Hacker-007/EnviousProgrammingLanguage/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Hacker-007/EnviousProgrammingLanguage/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Envious will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open an issue on GitHub with sufficient information about the feature or changes. Use the tag "new idea" to label the issue as a new idea. This process will change in the future though.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Read through the documentation or open an issue about the documentation and the specific part of the source code that does not make sense. Once again, this will change in the future.
